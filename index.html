        <h1>Fuck Corona</h1>
        <h2>Keep distance!</h2>
        <h3><a name="Description">Description</a></h3>
        <p>In modern society one of the things that threatens us the most is pandemic diseases. The modern world is connected and crowded, thus it is important for us to keep our distance to minimize the spread of disease. Fuck Corona is a campaign created to spread awareness about avoiding close contact and keeping distance. Our main focus is to make younger people, in the ages 20-30, to become more careful and feel included and responsible  for stopping the spread. Since corona generally does not affect younger people as much compared to the older fragile population, we still need to be aware that we mediate the spread. Especially since, recent scientific studies show that asymptomatic young people contribute significantly to societal spread. We use social media such as Instagram and snapchat to give out our message to keep social distance and follow your updated local restrictions and guidelines. Our numbers have increased substantially during the second wave of corona in the fall of 2020 and we plan to start a vaccine information campaign geared towards making young people aware of the necessity of getting vaccinated.</p>
        <h3><a name="About us">About us</a></h3>
        <p>Fuck Corona is a non-profit organisation with the aim to spread correct information founded in science to counteract misinformation and conspiracy theories floating around concerning the corona virus. At the moment we are 3 dedicated students who are conducting this campaign in our free time as we are studying in high school. It started as a school assignment but working with this project and the positive feedback that we received from young people made us realise that the work we were doing was important. Thus we agreed to continue working with the campaign with renewed enthusiasm and our goal is to provide updated information as the pandemic progresses.</p>
